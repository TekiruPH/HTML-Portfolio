    <h2>I Simplify the Work of Teams</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, being able to simplify the work is all that matters.  
        I try as much as possible not to add a lot of complication in
    work.  And with the age of AI, i really think that more and more 
    of us should embrace less complexity.  Let's enjoy life. And rekindle 
    the days when a website is this simple.</p>

    <h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>
     <p>I took a full stack development course in Udemy.  
        And i need to showcase a raw HTML website without CSS.
        Although it does feel like the 80's calling me back. 
        I do like the simplicity this brings.  Not having to create styles.
        Or div classes. Or any of that React or Tailwind front end shenanigans.</p>

        <p> I do want to learn a little better than this. And i dont think ChatGPT 
        and Claude need prodding from me.</p>
