    <p>As a Revenue Operations leader, I don't just optimize processes—I architect the invisible machinery that transforms potential into profit. While others chase metrics, I pursue the white space between data points where true innovation breeds.</p>
    <p>Think of me as the conductor of a corporate orchestra, where every department plays its unique instrument, but the symphony of success only emerges when each note aligns perfectly with revenue goals. My approach? Ruthless efficiency meets creative disruption.</p>
    <p>Twenty years of scaling operations has taught me that the most dangerous phrase in business isn't "we can't do it"—it's "we've always done it this way." I've built my career on dismantling these comfortable assumptions, replacing them with data-driven strategies that challenge teams to reach beyond their grasp.</p>
    <p>My toolbox includes advanced analytics, cross-functional leadership, and an uncanny ability to see around corners. But my real superpower? Converting complexity into clarity and turning bottlenecks into breakthroughs.</p>
    <p>What excites me isn't just hitting targets—it's redefining what's possible in revenue operations. Because in a world obsessed with best practices, I believe the real magic happens when we dare to create next practices.</p>

    <p>Are you ready to stop playing by the old rules and start writing new ones?</p>
